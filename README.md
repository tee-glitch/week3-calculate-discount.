This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, the discount is applied.

If the discount percentage is less than 20%, the original price is returned (no discount applied).

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """
    Calculates the final price after applying a discount.
    If the discount is 20% or higher, apply it; otherwise, return the original price.
    """


How It Works

The user is prompted to enter the original price of the item.

The user enters the discount percentage.

The program calculates and prints the final price.

Enter the original price of the item: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price after 25.0% discount is: 750.0

Enter the original price of the item: 500
Enter the discount percentage: 10
No discount applied. Price remains: 500.0
